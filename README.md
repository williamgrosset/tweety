:bird: A barebone HTTP client built directly with sockets.

![alt text](https://github.com/williamgrosset/tweety/blob/master/example.gif "SmartClient example")

## TODO
+ Clean-up `SmartClient.py`
+ Error-handling for unknown hostnames
+ Close out all socket TCP connections? (`s.close()`)
+ Test on Linux (ssh)
+ `README.md` section descriptions

## Overview
This project was designed for an assignment for the [Computer Communications and Networks](https://github.com/williamgrosset/tweety/blob/master/csc361_p1.pdf) class. The purpose of this client is to support a basic `GET` request to a web server over the HTTP protocol. `SmartClient.py` will echo web server's support for HTTPs, highest HTTP version, and the available cookies. The HTTP/1.1 RFC 
  + RFC guidelines

### Usage 

```bash
# Prerequisite: Python 3.6.4
$ python3 SmartClient.py www.google.com

# Example Output
website: www.google.com
1. Support of HTTPS: yes
2. The newest HTTP version that the web server supports: HTTP/2.0
3. List of cookies:
name: -, key: 1P_JAR, domain name: .google.ca
name: -, key: NID, domain name: .google.ca
```

### Project Layout
`SmartClient` is the entry point that uses the custom helper files below. The Python libaries that were used are: `re`, `sys`, `socket`, `ssl`.

```bash
$ cd <PROJECT-PATH>/lib/
http2_negotiation.py  results_logger.py
http_parser.py        socket_helper.py
```

### Disclaimer
There are status codes that are not supported to reduce the scope of assignment requirements. This is my first time building a project with Python and the code has not been peer-reviewed.
